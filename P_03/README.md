# Python Practice Programs - DAY 3

## 1️⃣ Even and Odd Sum

📄 **File:** `SumEvenOdd.py`  
🧠 **Description:**  
Takes n numbers from the user and separately calculates the sum of even and odd numbers.

💻 **Example Run:**
```
Enter no. of values: 5
Enter no.: 10
Enter no.: 7
Enter no.: 4
Enter no.: 9
Enter no.: 2
Even sum:  16
Odd sum:  16
```

## 2️⃣ Skip First Multiple of k

📄 **File:** `PrintMultiples.py`  
🧠 **Description:**  
Reads n numbers and prints all numbers divisible by k, skipping the first multiple found.

💻 **Example Run:**
```
Enter no. of values: 6
Enter k: 3
Enter no.: 9
Enter no.: 15
Enter no.: 6
Enter no.: 4
Enter no.: 18
Enter no.: 21
15 6 18 21 
```
*(First multiple 9 skipped)*

## 3️⃣ Alternate Even–Odd Pattern

📄 **File:** `AlternateSeries.py`  
🧠 **Description:**  
Takes n numbers and alternately collects even and odd numbers in sequence  
(i.e., even → odd → even → odd...).

💻 **Example Run:**
```
Enter no. of values: 7
Enter no.: 10
Enter no.: 8
Enter no.: 7
Enter no.: 3
Enter no.: 6
Enter no.: 5
Enter no.: 2
10 7 6 5 
```

## 4️⃣ Digit-Sum Recursion with Loop

📄 **File:** `DigitSum.py`  
🧠 **Description:**  
Continuously reads positive integers and computes the recursive digit sum until a single digit remains.  
Also prints the number of iterations it took for each number, and total numbers processed.

💻 **Example Run:**
```
Enter a positive integer (0 or negative to stop): 999
Iterations: 2 , Final digit: 9
Enter a positive integer (0 or negative to stop): 1234
Iterations: 1 , Final digit: 1
Enter a positive integer (0 or negative to stop): 0
Total numbers processed: 2
```

## 5️⃣ Count Consecutive Increasing Blocks

📄 **File:** `ConsecutiveBlocks.py`  
🧠 **Description:**  
Reads exactly 8 integers and counts how many increasing blocks exist,  
and finds the length of the longest block.

💻 **Example Run:**
```
Enter 8 integers:
2
3
5
1
2
3
3
4
Number of increasing blocks: 3
Length of the longest block: 3
```
